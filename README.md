# Breast-Cancer-Detection

The dataset comprises of Breast Cancer patients with Malignant and Benign tumor. K-nearest neighbour algorithm is used to predict whether the patient is sufferring from cancer or not. 

In this, I have trained a neural network with genetic algorithm to find the optimal K-value.
